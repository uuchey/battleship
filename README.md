# Python Battleship Game 

# This is a battle ship game that can be played from the
# python shell.
#
# Players start a new game then add their ships to a grid.
# Players then take turns guessing where their opponents ships are and shooting there. The players are very
# trusting and take turns using a python shell to play their game.
#
# Ships occupy 3 cells in the grid, cant overlap and must be fully on the grid. They can be either horizontal or
# vertical. When all three cells are hit, the ship is sunk
# When all the ships belonging to a player are sunk, that player is out of the game. The last player still in the game wins.
